# Hi there, I'm Rocky Decretales Jr. 👋

I'm a passionate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Cebu Institute of Technology University. Here's a little bit about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently enhancing my skills as a Salesforce developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in music, cooking, and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ropes of Salesforce development to expand my programming horizons.
- 💞️ I’m eager to learn more and elevate my programming skills to new heights.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Rocky1.decretales@gmail.com](mailto:Rocky1.decretales@gmail.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Spending time in nature, surrounded by trees, can lower blood pressure, reduce stress hormones, and boost immune function. It's no wonder why forest bathing, or "shinrin-yoku" in Japanese, has become a popular wellness practice around the world.
